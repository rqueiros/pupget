# pupget

## Open a new folder and initialize a package.json by using the command:

npm init -y

## Install our published npm package.

npm i pupget

## Create an index.js file and letâ€™s code.

const pupget = require("pupget"); // import the installed package

## Run this file by using the command:

node index.js

The output data from our NPM package would be stored in the same folder. Don't forget to create the DSL file. The possibilities are endless.
